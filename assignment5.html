            <img src="why even.gif" width=300 height=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            This is the button example from class
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="try.gif" width=300 height=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Here is the serial output that goes with the top gif, and just shows that the button is working
            </p>

            <h2>The example code I was using to try and understand this stuff</h2>
            <p>
            <img src="A5Code.JPG" width=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I got everything working with the hardware, but I just couldn't get the JS to work with it and display anything
	    </p>
            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p>
            <img src="circuit for a5.JPG" width=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            This is that example circuit. The LED is just for visual confirmation that the button is working
            </p>
	    <h2>Schematic (Lo-fi)</h2>
            <p>
            <img src="a5Schem.JPG" width=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            This is a very lo-fi schematic for that example code... I was defeated at this point so the effort reflects my remaining energy
            </p>
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <p>
            <img src="my life.JPG" width=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            This is where I would put my project code... IF I HAD ANY!!
            </p>
	    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            <img src="I Tried.JPG" width=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            In all seriousness I did try, and I had all of my JS files seemingly accurate, and the libraries/source code was all installed correctly <br>
            I guess maybe it was something with the python, although I am not even sure if/how I was supposed to be using it. Anyways I don't really expect <br>
	    To get many points for this assignment, but I did spend several hours attempting to learn this so I guess that is worth something ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br><br>
